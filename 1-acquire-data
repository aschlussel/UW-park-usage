SafeGraph provides data for a fee; however, academics can [apply for free data access](https://www.safegraph.com/academics).  A .edu email address is required.

Retrieving your data from SafeGraph can seem complicated at first, but do not be intimidated!  It is very doable.  Joel McCune of Esri has written an [excellent blog post](https://joelmccune.com/get-safegraph-places-by-poi-id-using-an-aws-ec2-instance-to/) on the beginning part of the process.  I recommend following his instructions.

At the end of these instructions, you will find yourself in Jupyter Notebooks.  Open Notebook 2.
